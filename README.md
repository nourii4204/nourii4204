## [Simple RISC Machine - CPEN 211](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Implemented a Turing Complete 16-bit RISC machine using System Verilog on an FPGA board in 3 weeks.
- Subdivided the machine into smaller modules to be designed, tested, and debugged more easily.
- Utilized pipelining to increase operations per cycle by 300% and go beyond course expectations.
