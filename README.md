Aside from tech, I enjoy honing my barista skills, always experimenting with fun new coffee flavors to keep myself caffeinated!

## [Simple RISC Machine](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Designed and implemented with a partner a high-performance, Turing-complete 16-bit RISC machine using
SystemVerilog on a DE1-SoC FPGA, completed within a 4-week timeline.
- Developed key components including an instruction decoder, ALU, controller state machine, and combinational
blocks, optimizing the architecture for modularity and ease of debugging.
- Achieved a 100% pass rate on the grading scheme by rigorously testing the system with over 40 test benches in
ModelSim, ensuring robust functionality and performance.

## [Crash Shell](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Designed and implemented an interactive UNIX shell in C, capable of running up to 32 processes concurrently in
both the foreground and background, enhancing user multitasking capabilities
- Ensured concurrent safety by masking and unmasking signals to prevent data races, reducing the risk of conflicts
and ensuring consistent behavior
- Achieved a 20% improvement in shell execution time through optimization techniques such as efficient memory
management

## [Memory Slab Allocator](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Designed and implemented a dynamically located heap structure in C, ensuring alignment on an 8-byte boundary
with a minimum block size of 64 bytes, bypassing the use of standard malloc functions
- Engineered a specialized allocation function employing distinct structs to allocate memory blocks strategically,
optimizing resource utilization
- Programmed a highly efficient free function that achieves coalescing in constant time (O(1)), enhancing memory
management and minimizing fragmentation
- Conducted thorough debugging sessions using GDB, ensuring code integrity and stability; validated the reliability
of the implementation using a self-designed heap consistency checker

## [GraphFlood: Terrain Flooding and Path Cost Analysis](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Engineered a graph class using a HashMap for an adjacency list and a HashSet for an adjacency matrix, adhering
to stakeholder-defined abstraction functions and representation invariants, ensuring optimal performance across
over 100 vertices
- Developed a path cost function to calculate path metrics based on a list of vertices and a specified PathCostType,
optimizing traversal efficiency across various graph structures
- Thoroughly tested implementations with over 50 unit tests and a custom-built GUI, utilizing the graph classes to
simulate and visualize flooding across 100+ terrain grid cells under varying water levels

## [Image Rendering and Processing System](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code) 
- Developed a pixel class to facilitate image rendering with animations like quarter color, stripe color, and border
color, achieving rendering times under 1 second per frame
- Implemented a flood-fill algorithm in C++ using both DFS and BFS, optimizing the process to efficiently fill large
images
- Created a dynamic image processing class that enabled complex pixel manipulation, allowing for a variety of visual
effects and enhanced image transformation capabilities
