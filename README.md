## **Highlighted Projects**

### [Simple RISC Machine](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code)  
- Co-designed and implemented a high-performance, Turing-complete 16-bit RISC machine using **SystemVerilog** on a DE1-SoC FPGA.
- Developed an **instruction decoder**, **ALU**, and **state machine**, focusing on modularity and ease of debugging.
- Achieved a 100% pass rate by rigorously testing with over 40 test benches in **ModelSim**.

---

### [Crash Shell](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code)  
- Designed an interactive **UNIX shell** in C, supporting up to **32 concurrent processes** in both the foreground and background.
- Improved execution time by **20%** through memory management optimizations and ensured concurrent safety by handling signals effectively.

---

### [Memory Slab Allocator](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code)  
- Developed a custom **memory allocator** in C, bypassing standard `malloc`, and ensuring efficient memory block alignment.
- Engineered an **O(1)** coalescing free function to enhance memory utilization and minimize fragmentation.
- Debugged and validated code using **GDB**, with a self-designed heap consistency checker.

---

### [GraphFlood: Terrain Flooding & Path Cost Analysis](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code)  
- Engineered a graph class using **HashMap** and **HashSet** for efficient performance across over 100 vertices.
- Developed a path cost function optimizing traversal efficiency across various graph structures.
- Built a **custom GUI** for simulating and visualizing terrain flooding across 100+ grid cells under varying water levels.

---

### [Image Rendering & Processing System](https://nourii4204.github.io/access-code)  
- Developed a pixel class enabling fast image rendering and dynamic animations, achieving sub-1-second rendering times.
- Implemented a flood-fill algorithm in C++ using both **DFS** and **BFS**, optimized for large images.
- Created a dynamic **image processing class** for advanced pixel manipulation and transformation effects.
